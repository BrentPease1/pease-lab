Sound is everywhere around us. Whether we are in the woods or in a city center, all landscapes have sounds that vary throughout the day, everyday of the year. Natural landscapes are often dominated by sounds of living organisms – frogs, insects, birds, even mammals – but we also hear the quiet, background noises – flowing streams, trees swaying in the wind. In other environments, we hear the hissing of garbage trucks, sirens from emergency vehicles, and children laughing and playing in parks. Together, the sounds emanating from each environment produce a unique “**soundscape**”. 

Sounds of Nature is a community research project to understand changes in biodiversity over time by studying soundscapes. Globally, we are losing biodiversity – the variety of living organisms on Earth - at unprecedented rates, and the widespread decline of many wildlife species is a growing concern for society. Studying the collective biodiversity – by listening – is a promising approach to learn about the health of an ecosystem across time and space, and, with new technology, is something that all of us can do!
