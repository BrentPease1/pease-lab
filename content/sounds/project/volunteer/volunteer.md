# Sounds of Nature Volunteers

Sounds of Nature is a community research project to understand changes in biodiversity over time by studying these soundscapes. Citizen science – engaging and involving the general public in scientific research – is a promising approach to tackling large-scale biodiversity issues. Through Sounds of Nature, a team of researchers and the public are participating in and contributing to a state-wide project to monitor biodiversity in their backyard and beyond.
