We are part of the [Forestry Program](https://coas.siu.edu/academics/departments/forestry/) at Southern Illinois University. Our research group focuses on applied wildlife conservation and management through the study of distributions and demographics of animal populations and communities. We work across taxa - birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians - on issues related to endangered species recovery, land management practices, and the conservation of biodiversity. Please explore our research projects and reach out to lab members with questions or potential collaborations.
