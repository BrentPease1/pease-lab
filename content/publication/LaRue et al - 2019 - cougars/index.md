abstract: Although cougars appear to be recolonizing the Midwestern U.S., there is concern that hunting in source populations may prevent cougars from dispersing eastward. We used carcass data of cougars in the Midwest collected during 1990-2015 to quantify whether cougar hunting in the Black Hills affected cougar distribution and presence in the Midwest. We separated carcass data into 2 time periods: before hunting in the Black Hills and after hunting. We hypothesized that if hunting indeed prevented dispersal into the Midwest, cougar distribution would be random and their presence less, relative to the pre-hunt period. We also were interested in the change in the sex of carcasses over time, given the importance of that demographic metric to the potential establishment of viable populations. During the pre-hunt period, 25 carcasses were dispersed randomly in the Midwest. However, during the post-hunt period, we found nearly 4 times the number of carcasses in the Midwest that were significantly clustered, and a greater proportion of females. Relative to the pre-hunt period, we observed a 460 km northward shift in the directional distribution of carcass locations during the post-hunt period. These findings do not support the idea that cougar hunting in the Black Hills has prevented cougar presence from increasing in the Midwest. Alternatively, we suggest the potential for immigration from cougar populations farther to the west as an explanation for the increase in cougar presence confirmed in the Midwest after the initiation of cougar hunting in the Black Hills. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Although cougars (Puma concolor) appear to be recolonizing the midwestern United States, there is concern that hunting in source populations may prevent cougars from dispersing eastward. We use carcass data of cougars in the Midwest collected during 1990â€“2015 to quantify whether cougar hunting in the Black Hills affected cougar distribution and presence in the Midwest.
