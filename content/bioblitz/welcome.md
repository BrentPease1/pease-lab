The Saluki BioBlitz is an annual 24-hour challenge to document biodiversity across SIU's Carbondale campus. At a *BioBlitz*, students, faculty, staff, scientists, families, and the general public work together to get a snapshot of an areaâ€™s biodiversity. Using the [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org) platform, participants create digital records of which species are found (and not found!) on campus. The event is a great way to document and learn about the biodiversity across campus while contributing to the Pease Lab's and SIU Forestry Program's ongoing efforts of documenting biodiversity across the region.
