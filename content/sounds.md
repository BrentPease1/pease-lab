### Overview    

Sound is everywhere around us. Whether we are in the woods or in a city center, all landscapes have sounds that vary throughout the day, everyday of the year. Natural landscapes are often dominated by sounds of living organisms – frogs, insects, birds, even mammals – but we also hear the quiet, background noises – flowing streams, trees swaying in the wind. In other environments, we hear the hissing of garbage trucks, sirens from emergency vehicles, and children laughing and playing in parks. Together, the sounds emanating from each environment produce a unique “**soundscape**”.    

Sounds of Nature is a community research project to understand changes in biodiversity over time by studying these soundscapes. Globally, we are losing biodiversity – the variety of living organisms on Earth - at unprecedented rates, and the widespread decline of many wildlife species is a growing concern for society. Studying the collective biodiversity – by listening – is a promising approach to learn about the health of an ecosystem across time and space, and, with new technology, is something that all of us can do!    

Citizen science – engaging and involving the general public in scientific research – is a promising approach to tackling large-scale biodiversity issues. Through Sounds of Nature, a team of researchers and the public are participating in and contributing to a state-wide project to monitor biodiversity in their backyard and beyond. Our first step in this multi-year project is to focus on one sentinel of change – birds!

### Background    

Bird populations have been declining globally, with recent estimates suggesting a loss of 3 billion birds since the 1970s. Sounds of Nature’s first goal is to better understand drivers of this loss across Illinois. Historically, the only way to determine where bird species were across large areas required a lot of human effort and time. In Illinois, one such effort was the Illinois Breeding Brid Atlas which was conducted throughout the entire state in the 1986-91. In this project, hundreds of volunteers and organizers conducted bird counts across the entire state of Illinois. This was an incredible effort, and some really important information for wildlife conservation and management was collected. Fast forward 30 years, and we’re in a new era of wildlife monitoring, with incredible technology available to aid in reducing and reversing global wildlife declines.    

### Approach    

In Sounds of Nature, we are using innovative monitoring of soundscapes combined with the power of the public through citizen science to detect large-scale changes in biodiversity across our region. Teams of university researchers and citizen scientists use inexpensive, portal sound recorders to collect sounds for a few days across forests, grasslands, agricultural areas, and even urban areas throughout Illinois. Our teams then retrieve the recorders and transfer recorded soundscapes to a computer system to be processed with modern machine learning techniques in bioacoustic analysis. Our researchers review recordings and identify birds by their calls. These representative bird calls are used to train a computer routine to automatically identify birds in hours and hours of soundscape recordings. We couple the information of which bird species are detected across with remote sensing information to understand how changes in land cover, climate, and land use have affected birds and the greater biodiversity of our region.

### Volunteer    

#### New to Sounds of Nature?  

Interested in participating in our project and hosting an acoustic recorder on your property? We’d love to have you join our efforts!    

Please submit a request form through our [application portal](https://siucarbondale.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=7b281cf01f864a9bba54d4881196c423) by selecting the block you live in and filling out the application. We will follow up as soon as we can!

#### Contacted by our team?    

For the first year of the project, we have selected blocks across southern Illinois and are contacting private landowners within these randomly selected blocks. You are an important part of this project and we would love to have your support!    

###### What is required from you?      

Absolutely nothing! If you want to be more involved, there are options to do so. 

###### What EXACTLY will we be doing on your property?     

We will need access to your property a total of two times – once to deploy the sound recorder and the other to retrieve it. The sound recorder can be placed anywhere on your property, and you may specify a location if you would like. If you do not have an opinion on the specific location, we will pick a location that is discrete and accessible.

The sound recorder will be on your property for 5-7 days and will be programmed to record from 5-9am for birds like warblers or thrush’s, and 6-10pm to listen for nocturnal birds like the whip-poor-wills and owls. We will also briefly survey vegetation directly around the recorder but will not remove or modify the vegetation in any way. At retrieval, we will simply remove the sound recorder from the tree it was mounted on.

###### When will this happen?     

We will visit your property between May 1st and July 22nd 2022. If you are willing to participate, we will contact you 1-2 days before visiting your property.

### General Questions    

##### Why are you studying birds?      

Many bird species in southern Illinois (and beyond!) are declining. Some reasons are loss of habitat and changes in food resources. We want to monitor which bird species are found throughout southern Illinois and try to understand what might be causing their decline. We hope this information will be helpful to wildlife managers. 

##### Which bird species are you focused on?     

One of our main focuses is nocturnal birds, like the Whip-poor-will, which are often overlooked because they are so well camouflaged and only active at night.  

##### What will happen to the sound recordings?     

We will use the data to detect different species of bird. We are particularly interested in birds that sing at dawn and nocturnal birds like whip-poor-wills and owls. There will be no names associated with the recording data, just longitude and latitude. Data will be stored at Southern Illinois University. 

Full data will NEVER be publicly available. Very small segments when birds are calling may be used. 

##### Why my property?     

If you were contacted by our team, it is because your property was randomly selected for our first year. We randomly selected property based on accessibility to roads. We want to understand all species of birds in southern Illinois and are not looking for any particular land types.  

##### Why record at these times of day?      

We are particularly interested in certain nocturnal birds that are rarely detected so we are recording at times when they are most likely to be calling. Birds are also highly active right around dawn.   

##### Where are you surveying?      

In our first year, we are surveying the southernmost 16 counties of Illinois on privately and publicly owned land.
